# Purpose: Determine which time is earlier
# Pre-conditions: 6 integers
# Post-conditions: One of three values: 0, 1 , or 2.
#                  0 = same time
#                  1 = 1st time was earlier
#                  2 = 2nd time was earlier

#                  Outputs the comparison of the two input times
#                  Outputs prompts for input until -1 is given as an input on first_hours
